## Overview
For this project, the focus was to test the usage of connecting Javascript with SQL. A database, called Bamazon, was created with
the tables Products and Department. This project contains 3 different JS files:
1) A customer JS
2) A Supervisor JS
3) A Manager JS
Each JS has its own distinct functions which relate to the name and their role within a store. Below are examples of said functions:
